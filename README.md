## 👋 Hi there, Ding here. Welcome to my GitHub Profile! 😃

I'm a Software Developer and a Cloud Engineer. I'm passionate about:

- Designing cloud native distributed systems.
- Creating CI/CD automation pipelines.
- Building Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solutions.

I'm always curious on:

- Learning and applying new technologies.
- Exploring different software development paradigms.

When not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, and hiking. 🚶‍♂️
